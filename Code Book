# Code Book
## Introduction
* This project will use six variables from UCI HAR Dataset. On the right side its name once they're converted.
x_train.txt <- x_train
x_test.txt <- x_test
y_train.txt <- y_train
y_test.txt <- y_test
subject_train.txt <- ID_train
subject_test.txt <- ID_test
* The features.txt contains the correct variable name from x_train.txt and x_test.txt. More info about them in features_info.txt.
* The activity_labels.txt contains the desciptive names for each activity label and their code. 

## Merged data
X variable contains x_train and x_test
Y variable contains y_train and y_test
ID contains ID_train and ID_test
With these 3 variables a data frame it's been created. It's been selected just mean and std measurement in it. 
5th step, wich involve to take the average from each subject and each activity, it was used this data frame. 

##Final labels (reanmming list). 
* Code column <-  activities
* Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
* Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
* BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
* Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
* start with character f <- Frequency
* start with character t <- Time
tBody <- TimeBody
* end in "-mean" <- Mean
* end in "-std()" <- STD
* end in "-freq()" <- Frequency
* angle <- Angle)
* gravity <- Gravity
